# Open Science Workshop at the 33C3

# Text for the wiki

https://events.ccc.de/congress/2016/wiki/Session:Open_Science_Workshop

Do you think science is as open, transparent and reproducible as it
could be? Are we using the full potential of digitalization and the
internet for our research. Are non-scientist sufficiently aware of and
embedded into the scientific process? We want to discuss all this and
want to hear your voice and experiences! Open Access, Open Data, Open
Notebooks, Open Source, Open Educational Resources Citizen science -
those topics and more will be in the center of this participant-driven
meeting. More importantly we want to connect people interested in a
more open and better science.

### What is Open Science

Arrange modules of open science (like open data, open access, open peer review) around the research cycle.
